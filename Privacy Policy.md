# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how Mr. S.I.M.P. (the "Bot") handles user data. The short answer? It doesn’t. Here’s the full breakdown:

1. No Data Collection
The Bot does not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive data from users.
All interactions occur in real-time within Discord, and no information is retained after the Bot processes a command.
2. No Third-Party Sharing
Since no data is collected, there is nothing to share with third parties. Simple as that.
3. Your Privacy
Your privacy is fully respected. By using the Bot, you can be confident that no information about you or your activity is logged or saved.
4. Changes to This Policy
If the Bot’s functionality changes in the future and requires handling user data, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. For now, you don’t have to worry about your data.
